Sense Beliefs: Turn raw sensory data (obtained from env/sense env) into more advanced concepts (such as acknowledging the presence of a square,
					its size, location, color, whether it's filled in or not, rotation, etc.)
					
Goal Beliefs: Set up an imagined reality and compare the currently existing one to it (exporting whether they match and if they're getting closer
					to matching)

Action Beliefs: Are potential behaviors the agi can take (designated pattern of raw Util class commands)




All Beliefs are meant to abstract away raw sensory input and raw actions and can utilize sub-beliefs of its type to abstract away highly complex
	neural paths.
	
	
	
A LLF is a moment of consciousness which is supported by previous beliefs (which determine the awareness, goals to resume, and actions discovered),

			previous environment (which helps to compare environments from one moment to the next), previous satisfaction (how well it was
					meeting goals in the previous instance of existence),
					
			previous action taken (remember what it did in the previous instance),
			
			previous errors encountered (remember where the code fucked up so it can be fixed).
