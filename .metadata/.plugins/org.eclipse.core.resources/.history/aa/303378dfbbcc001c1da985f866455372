Guide to writing AGI Code:

Write java like normal except:

After a semicolon add "end"   Ex: System.out.println("Test");end)

After an if statement without any sort of else add "block" and the current layer of code instead of brackets
								Ex: if ()block0
										System.out.println("Test");end
									block0
									
									
									
After an if statement with some sort of else add "cblock" and the current layer of code instead of the first
	opening bracket, "block" and the current layer of code to close it, then "tblock" and the current layer
	of code instead of the else opening bracket, and "block" and the current layer of code to close the else
	
	
								Ex: if ()cblock0
										System.out.println("Test");end
									block0 else tblock0
										System.out.println("Test2");end
									block0
