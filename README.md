What is this repo?

A collection of older versions of my implementations of the artificial general intelligence diagrams I drew up. Refer to WhiteSpikeVision for the most recent/cleanest version of the project. That most recent version only has the env creation (enabling the AGI to interact with visual stimuli) completed, while the main decision-making process (the LF and LLF) are only present in the older versions.


So could I make a fully-functional AGI with the stuff in this repo?
Yes. Will take some effort to extract the useful info though.


Why hasn't this blown up?
In my mind, base-level-AGI doesn't seem that useful. This is because it already widely exists (pretty much anything living, especially us humans are "general intelligence"). So why re-create all that existing "tech" when a model like this effectively has the intelligence of a newborn and will take a considerable amount of time in order to compete. Yes, once it is able to compete with, and eventually outcompete, humans then people will want it but that's a lot of time/effort and I need to earn money to live.


Next steps?
Currently trying to find a job so I can support myself.

Then after that the plan is to achieve financial independence as quickly as possible (likely through a startup on the side) so I can return to this full time and nurture it into that "outperforming humans" state.

The project's next steps are to create a seperate library that utilizes the actual learning functionality from the LF and LLF in a clean, bug-free way. (Essentially re-creating what I already have in this repo in a clean way so it makes sense to end users)


How can I help?
By contributing, either through completing the dev work (can email me at: jonahmschreiner@gmail.com) or monetarily (although would have to be enough for me to return to working on it full-time in order for you to receive a benefit) or through introducing me to people who can help with either of the first two.
